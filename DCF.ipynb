    "This notebook calculates the Enterprise Value and Implied Share Price of a hypothetical company using a DCF model. It starts by projecting revenue and then derives Free Cash Flow (FCF), incorporating EBIT margin expansion. Equity Value is derived from Enterprise Value by subtracting Total Debt and adding Cash & Cash Equivalents. The WACC is calculated within the notebook, including the cost of debt.\n"
